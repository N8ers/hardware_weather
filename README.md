# hardware_weather

This is a simple weather app, with a fun twist! Using Fetch API to get Data from DarkSky, this electron application can sit in the
background of you desktop, auto fetching the weather ever 15 minutes. If you want an extra challenge, you can make it run on a 
raspberry pi! Checkout the github link below to learn more!
